# 02 - Understand the basic model, service and persistence features

In the previous exercise we conjured up a simple but fully functional OData
service from a declarative definition that is just a few lines long. In this
exercise we'll explore what we have, to understand the central importance of
the model, what the service is, and how the definition relates to a database
layer.

## Explore the service

👉 Open up <http://localhost:4004/> in your browser to see the default CAP
server landing page:

![Default CAP server landing page](assets/default-cap-server-landing-page.png)

### Make some read requests

👉 Examine some of the resources available via the various hyperlinks:

- [http://localhost:4004/odata/v4/simple](http://localhost:4004/odata/v4/simple)
  (the OData service document)
- [http://localhost:4004/odata/v4/simple/\$metadata](http://localhost:4004/odata/v4/simple/$metadata)
  (the OData metadata document)
- [Fiori
  preview](http://localhost:4004/$fiori-preview/Simple/Products#preview-app) (a
  basic Fiori elements List Report app where the Products data can be viewed)
- [http://localhost:4004/odata/v4/simple/Products](http://localhost:4004/odata/v4/simple/Products)
  (an entityset with the Products data)

👉 Based on this last products entityset resource, try out some standard OData
URL-based query mechanisms (admittedly these are somewhat limited, given the
rather limited nature of our dataset), such as:

- [http://localhost:4004/odata/v4/simple/Products/3](http://localhost:4004/odata/v4/simple/Products/3)
  (retrieve the Product with ID 3)
- [http://localhost:4004/odata/v4/simple/Products?\$filter=contains(name,%27Syrup%27)](http://localhost:4004/odata/v4/simple/Products?$filter=contains(name,'Syrup'))
  (return an entityset with products that have "Syrup" in their name)
- [http://localhost:4004/odata/v4/simple/Products?\$select=name](http://localhost:4004/odata/v4/simple/Products?$select=name)
  (all the products, just with the name property for each entity)

> By default the key property (`ID` here) is returned as well.

### Try some write requests too

At the shell prompt, try one or more of these:

👉 Add a new product:

```bash
# Get the latest product ID
lastid="$(
  curl -s 'localhost:4004/odata/v4/simple/Products?$orderby=ID%20desc&$top=1' | \
    jq '.value|first|.ID'
)"

# Increment the ID
nextid="$((lastid + 1))"

# Send an OData create operation with the incremented ID
curl \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"ID":'"$nextid"',"name":"New Product ('"$nextid"')","stock":10}' \
  --url 'localhost:4004/odata/v4/simple/Products'
```

👉 Change the name of product ID 3:

```bash
curl \
  --request PATCH \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"name": "Aniseed Sauce"}' \
  --url 'localhost:4004/odata/v4/simple/Products/3'
```

👉 Remove the "Chai" product:

```bash
curl --request DELETE \
  --url 'localhost:4004/odata/v4/simple/Products/1'
```

## Understand how the definition is used

These days it's hard to imagine how much work it used to be, before the advent
of CAP, to get an OData service like this up and running. But that's not the
point of this exercise nor this workshop. Instead, let's take a quick look at
what "descends" from the definition.

The definition is written using the Conceptual Definition Language
([CDL](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/cds/cdl)), the human-readable form of the
declarative language designed to be used by domain experts and developers to
build a solution based on the foundation of the domain model that underpins it.

### Get an introduction to Core Schema Notation

The CAP server uses the CDS model definition to provide an appropriate OData
service here, out of the box. But it uses it in a more readily machine-readable
form called Core Schema Notation ([CSN](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/cds/csn),
pronounced "season") and which can come in two common representations - JSON and
YAML.

Let's remind ourselves of the CDS model we have, written in CDL:

```cds
service Simple {
  entity Products {
    key ID    : Integer;
        name  : String;
        stock : Integer;
  }
}
```

#### CSN in JSON

👉 Generate the CSN equivalent of this model, in a JSON representation:

```bash
cds compile --to json services.cds
```

This emits:

```json
{
  "definitions": {
    "Simple": {
      "@source": "services.cds",
      "kind": "service"
    },
    "Simple.Products": {
      "kind": "entity",
      "elements": {
        "ID": {
          "key": true,
          "type": "cds.Integer"
        },
        "name": {
          "type": "cds.String"
        },
        "stock": {
          "type": "cds.Integer"
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "meta": {
    "creator": "CDS Compiler v6.4.6",
    "flavor": "inferred"
  },
  "$version": "2.0"
}

```

> This is a very common request and so can also be produced with the shorter
> `cds c .`, where `.` is a reference to the current directory, which only
> contains a single `services.cds` source file at this point anyway.

While JSON is arguably "the default", YAML is easier on the eye so we'll use
that as our go-to representation throughout this workshop whenever we want to
look at CSN.

#### CSN in YAML

👉 Re-generate the CSN equivalent of this model, this time in a YAML representation:

```bash
cds compile --to yaml services.cds
```

This emits:

```yaml
definitions:
  Simple: { kind: service }
  Simple.Products:
    kind: entity
    elements:
      {
        ID: { key: true, type: cds.Integer },
        name: { type: cds.String },
        stock: { type: cds.Integer },
      }
meta: { creator: CDS Compiler v6.4.6, flavor: inferred }
$version: 2.0
```

> Here, for purposes of display and readability in these workshop exercises,
> the YAML has been passed through [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), "an
> opinionated code formatter".

While we won't need to look much further at CSN in this workshop, it's
important to understand that it exists and is the "processable" version of the
definitions we construct in our CDS models. We'll occasionally use CSN in
subsequent exercises to bolster our understanding, where appropriate.

### SQL and DDL

At some point the data model part of our definitions will need to have some
form of presence at a persistence layer. In other words, we'll want to store
the data in our model, the records that make up the data in our entities, and
the projections upon them, and so on.

When we started our CAP server with `cds watch` earlier, this compiled the CDL
into SQL (more accurately
[DDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_definition_language), a specific
syntax in the SQL world for defining database objects themselves, rather than
working with the data within), in order to be able to deploy the data model to
a persistence layer.

In development mode, by default, this persistence layer is provided by the
quietly powerful and ubiquitous [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/) database engine.
Also by default in this context, it will be started in "in-memory" mode, i.e.
ephemeral persistence (if that is not an oxymoron) for the duration of the CAP
server's lifetime. This is incredibly useful for rapid turnaround and
local-first development.

> If you want to learn more about what CAP has to offer for local-first
> development, come to the technical talk [Local-first: A more efficient
> development strategy for extending with the SAP Cloud Application Programming
> Model](https://virtual.oxfordabstracts.com/event/75555/submission/127)
> tomorrow (Mon 01 Dec).

When looking at the log output from the CAP server in the previous exercise, we
saw:

```log
[cds] - connect to db > sqlite { url: ':memory:' }
  > init from db/data/Simple.Products.csv
/> successfully deployed to in-memory database.
```

This reflects what's happening - the model is compiled and deployed to a SQLite
powered in-memory persistence layer.

> This mode is employed directly because of the design-time options we
> requested implicitly with `cds watch`, which were (as you also may have
> noticed in the log output): `cds serve all --with-mocks --in-memory?`.

👉 Take a look at what that looks like by asking for the SQL equivalent:

```bash
cds compile --to sql services.cds
```

This emits:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Simple_Products (
  ID INTEGER NOT NULL,
  name NVARCHAR(255),
  stock INTEGER,
  PRIMARY KEY(ID)
);
```

> There's also the HANA specific equivalent for when deployment is to an SAP
> HANA powered persistence layer, which can be summoned with `cds compile --to
> hana services.cds` and looks like this:
>
> ```sql
> ----- Simple.Products.hdbtable -----
> COLUMN TABLE Simple_Products (
>   ID INTEGER NOT NULL,
>   name NVARCHAR(5000),
>   stock INTEGER,
>   PRIMARY KEY(ID)
> )
> ```

## Deployments (bonus)

If you're curious about how this ends up in production, say, with an SAP HANA
Cloud backend, you can prepare a deployment to see what's generated, and inspect
the individual assets such as HDI container artifacts and table data (`.hdbtable`)
files.

### Build for production

👉 To do this, use:

```bash
cds build --profile production
```

which will produce output something like this:

```log
building project with {
  versions: { cds: '9.4.4', compiler: '6.4.6', dk: '9.4.3' },
  target: 'gen',
  tasks: [
    { src: 'db', for: 'hana', options: { model: [ 'db', 'srv', 'app', 'services', '@sap/cds/srv/outbox' ] } },
    { src: 'srv', for: 'nodejs', options: { model: [ 'db', 'srv', 'app', 'services', '@sap/cds/srv/outbox' ] } }
  ]
}
done > wrote output to:
   gen/db/package.json
   gen/db/src/gen/.hdiconfig
   gen/db/src/gen/.hdinamespace
   gen/db/src/gen/Simple.Products.hdbtable
   gen/db/src/gen/cds.outbox.Messages.hdbtable
   gen/srv/package-lock.json
   gen/srv/package.json
   gen/srv/srv/_i18n/i18n.json
   gen/srv/srv/csn.json
   gen/srv/srv/odata/v4/Simple.xml

build completed in 780 ms
```

### Deploy to a SQLite database file

And to finish off, back to design (non-production) time, you can even deploy to
a SQLite database file which you can explore using the SQLite command line interface.

👉 Use this command:

```bash
cds deploy --to sqlite:test.db
```

which emits something like this:

```log
  > init from db/data/Simple.Products.csv
/> successfully deployed to test.db

```

👉 Then invoke the SQLite command line interface, specifying the name of the
file created:

```bash
sqlite3 test.db
```

This gives you a prompt:

```log
SQLite version 3.40.1 2022-12-28 14:03:47
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite>
```

where you can, for example:

- explore with commands such as `.tables`
- request data with `select * from Simple_Products;`
- query the schema with `select * from sqlite_schema;`

```log
sqlite> .tables
Simple_Products      cds_outbox_Messages
sqlite> select * from Simple_Products;
1|Chai|39
2|Chang|17
3|Aniseed Syrup|13
sqlite> select * from sqlite_schema;
table|Simple_Products|Simple_Products|2|CREATE TABLE Simple_Products (
  ID INTEGER NOT NULL,
  name NVARCHAR(255),
  stock INTEGER,
  PRIMARY KEY(ID)
)
table|cds_outbox_Messages|cds_outbox_Messages|3|CREATE TABLE cds_outbox_Messages (
  ID NVARCHAR(36) NOT NULL,
  timestamp TIMESTAMP_TEXT,
  target NVARCHAR(255),
  msg NCLOB,
  attempts INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  "partition" INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  lastError NCLOB,
  lastAttemptTimestamp TIMESTAMP_TEXT,
  status NVARCHAR(23),
  PRIMARY KEY(ID)
)
index|sqlite_autoindex_cds_outbox_Messages_1|cds_outbox_Messages|4|
sqlite>
```

> `cds_outbox_Messages` is a built-in table related to the
> [Queuing](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/node.js/queue) facilities.

You can exit the `sqlite3` prompt with `Ctrl-D`.

👉 If you've run the `cds build` command, clean up before moving on to the next
exercise, by removing the `gen/` directory, as we won't need it:

```bash
rm -rf gen/
```

Good work!
