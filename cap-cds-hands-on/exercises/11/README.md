# 11 - Take a first look at domain specific custom operations

In this exercise we'll take a look at how we can define and implement custom
functions in your services.

What does "custom" mean here? It depends on the context. Consider API styles
based on the HTTP application protocol, which translate to two of the protocols
supported out of the box by CAP, namely "REST" and OData.

> Technically speaking REST is more of an architectural style than a protocol;
> so where you see "REST", think
> [HTTP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ic37FI351G4).

## Think about HTTP's approach with verbs and nouns

In this context, the surface area of an API is made up of a small number of
standard "verbs" (HTTP methods) and an almost infinite number of "nouns"
(resources, addressed via URLs). Consequently, standard APIs look similar, in
that each offer CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations on resources
that normally represent business data.

> HTTP and CRUD are generally related and the methods and operations
> (respectively) can be approximated to each other thus:
>
> CRUD | HTTP
> -|-
> Create | POST
> Read | GET
> Update | PUT (or PATCH)
> Delete | DELETE

The entities in our domain model, exposed via projections in our `Simple`
service, are a perfect example of that, and through that service we are able to
send requests of each operational type to create, read, update and delete
instances of the entities (products, suppliers, and so on).

While this approach is aligned with the philosophy of the underlying
application protocol (HTTP), there are some circumstances where a more "remote
procedure call" ([RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call))
style of API facility is desirable, where the endpoint (target resource) is
more opaque and the semantics of the operation do not align cleanly with the
HTTP method used; in fact, HTTP is relegated to a transport protocol in such
cases.

## Consider OData's actions and functions

If we look at OData (specifically V4), we see that beyond the HTTP oriented
support for the standard operations (CRUD plus Q for "Query", an OData specific
form of read), there are provisions for such "out-of-band" mechanisms in the
form of actions and functions.

And CAP has [first class
provision](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/providing-services#actions-functions)
for such mechanisms.

> Not only can actions and functions be defined and employed in the context of
> services that are explicitly or implicitly served via OData, but also via the
> more generic HTTP-grounded "REST" protocol.

### Understand the scope of actions and functions

Actions and functions are for different purposes, and each can be bound or unbound.

👉 Visit Capire's [Actions &
Functions](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/guides/providing-services#actions-functions)
topic page where you'll see:

- Actions modify data in the server
- Functions retrieve data
- Unbound actions/functions are like plain unbound functions in JavaScript.
- Bound actions/functions always receive the bound entity's primary key as
  implicit first argument, similar to this pointers in Java or JavaScript

Additionally:

- functions are invoked via GET, whereas actions, which have side-effects (i.e.
  they modify data on the server) must be invoked via POST

If you really must, you can think of the difference between bound and unbound
as similar to the difference between instance and static methods in object
oriented programming.

## Define an unbound function in the Simple service

Let's take our first steps in this regard with a simple function that should
return just those products that are out of stock.

Because this is going to be read-only, a function is appropriate. Because we
want to have products returned to us from the entire set, the function is to be
unbound rather than bound.

### Add the declaration

👉 In `srv/services.cds`, add the definition for an `outOfStockProducts`
function within the `Simple` service as shown:

```cds
@protocol: 'odata'
@path    : '/simple'
service Simple {
  entity Products  as projection on workshop.Products;
  entity Suppliers as projection on workshop.Suppliers;
  entity Orders    as projection on workshop.Orders;
  function outOfStockProducts() returns many Products;
}
```

Note that this unbound function is as simple as it can be for the purposes of
this introduction, and expects no arguments (there is nothing defined within
the `()` signature).

### Try to invoke the function

👉 Ensure that the CAP server has restarted after this change, and visit
<http://localhost:4004> to see the service endpoints; pay particular attention
to the entries for the `Simple` service, which should now include this
function:

![outOfStockProducts() listed in the service](assets/outOfStockProducts-function.png)

Because it's a function, rather than an action, it is to be invoked via HTTP
GET, which means we can try it out in the browser.

👉 Do that now - select the function
<http://localhost:4004/simple/outOfStockProducts>.

In contrast to every other request you've made, each of which has been
fulfilled by the CAP framework itself with built-in handling for all CRUD style
operations, this "out-of-band" call is something we're going to have to provide
an implementation for ourselves, as we can see from the error message returned:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Service \"Simple\" has no handler for \"outOfStockProducts\".",
    "code": "501",
    "@Common.numericSeverity": 4
  }
}
```

### Provide an implementation

👉 Create a new file `srv/services.js`, with the following content:

```javascript
const cds = require('@sap/cds')

class Simple extends cds.ApplicationService {
  init() {
    const { Products } = this.entities('workshop')
    this.on('outOfStockProducts', async () => {
      return await SELECT.from(Products).where({ stock: 0 })
    })
    return super.init()
  }
}
module.exports = { Simple }
```

While digging into this JavaScript is beyond the scope of this CDS modelling
introduction workshop, there are a few points worth highlighting:

- The name of the file matches the name of the service definition file (save
  for the extension), according to the [convention over configuration
  here](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/node.js/core-services#in-sibling-js-files-next-to-cds-sources)
- The name of the class is `Simple`, matching the `Simple` service name in the
  CDS file
- The handler for the unbound function is defined in the [on
  phase](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/node.js/core-services#srv-on-request)

### Try the function invocation again

👉 Take a look at our initial data in the CSV files, specifically
`db/data/workshop-Products.csv`, and you'll see that there's a product, "Chef
Anton's Gumbo Mix", where the value for `stock` is indeed `0`:

```csv
ID,name,stock,price_amount,price_currency_code,supplier_ID
1,Chai,39,18,GBP,1
2,Chang,17,19,GBP,1
3,Aniseed Syrup,13,10,GBP,1
4,"Chef Anton's Cajun Seasoning",53,22,GBP,2
5,"Chef Anton's Gumbo Mix",0,21.35,GBP,2
6,"Grandma's Boysenberry Spread",120,25,GBP,3
```

#### Modify the initial data

Let's make it slightly more exciting, so that we have more than one entry in
the entityset returned.

👉 Edit the CSV file and change the `stock` value `39` for the product with
`ID` of `1` ("Chai") to `0`.

The CAP server should restart automatically.

#### Make the call

👉 Now retry the unbound function, by requesting
<http://localhost:4004/simple/outOfStockProducts>. It should return an
entityset with "Chai" and "Chef Anton's Gumbo Mix":

```json
{
  "@odata.context": "$metadata#Products",
  "value": [
    {
      "ID": 1,
      "name": "Chai",
      "stock": 0,
      "price_amount": 18,
      "price_currency_code": "GBP",
      "supplier_ID": 1
    },
    {
      "ID": 5,
      "name": "Chef Anton's Gumbo Mix",
      "stock": 0,
      "price_amount": 21.35,
      "price_currency_code": "GBP",
      "supplier_ID": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

Great! We've just learned how we can define and provide the business logic for
a custom function.

## Replace the function with a declarative infix filter

The function we chose to implement was deliberately simple, of course. But did
you know that we don't even need a function for such a facility?

One of the best features of developing with the CAP framework is that it allows
us to push out logic and mechanics to the extremities:

- upwards to the declarative surface area of our domain model (and related
  service definitions)
- downwards to the persistence layer where complex queries can be handled
  directly and natively by the database systems

To round off this exercise, let's make that same feature available (the listing
of products that are out of stock) without having to write a single line of
custom code.

### Remove the custom implementation

👉 Start out by deleting the `srv/services.js` file as we don't need it any more.

#### Redefine the facility as a projection

👉 Next, remove the `outOfStockProducts()` function definition from the
`Simple` service, replacing it with another entity projection called
`OutOfStockProducts` as shown. Also, add the annotation
`@cds.redirection.target` to the `Products` entity projection. Once you're
done, the `Simple` service definition should look like this:

```cds
@protocol: 'odata'
@path    : '/simple'
service Simple {
  @cds.redirection.target
  entity Products           as projection on workshop.Products;

  entity Suppliers          as projection on workshop.Suppliers;
  entity Orders             as projection on workshop.Orders;
  entity OutOfStockProducts as projection on workshop.Products[stock <= 0];
}
```

#### Examine what we've done

What have we done here? Importantly, we have:

- moved from a procedural approach that required custom business logic,
  to a purely declarative one using the power of CAP's domain modelling
  language CDL
- that power specifically here is the `[stock <= 0]` part which is an [infix
  filter](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/cds/cdl#publish-associations-with-filter)

Unrelated directly to the use of an infix filter, and more related to the fact
that we have defined a second projection on the same base entity
(`workshop.Products`), we have also:

- added the annotation
  [@cds.redirection.target](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/cds/cdl#using-cds-redirection-target-annotations)
  to help the compiler resolve any ambiguity between the two possible
  destinations for association based relationships

Now that we've made these changes and got rid of the `srv/services.js` file,
make sure the CAP server has restarted and visit the CAP server home page again
at <http://localhost:4004/>, where this new resource is exposed, as an entity
this time of course, and not as a function:

![OutOfStockProducts entity exposed](assets/OutOfStockProducts-entity.png)

👉 Select that entity link to get to the entityset resource, which should
reflect the same data as the function did: the products "Chai" and "Chef
Anton's Gumbo Mix".

Nice!
